Plotted reward and cost trace sums for WT Strio learned mice in DZP and saline sessions that were injected w/0.5mg/kg DZP.
Each trial's reward/cost trace is a data point; each mouse is a line plot.
For mice with 2 saline sessions, the average of the mean trace sum of the sessions was calculated.
This is why in DATATABLE.mat, the saline values are single values instead of arrays.
However, SE (standard error) in DATATABLE.mat for saline was calculated from concatenation of the trace data on the trial level.
