3A: For WT Strio learned mice, plotted reward trace area (reward trace area minus cost trace area) vs. d' for each period (ITI, tone, response, outcome)
Data for all mice are combined and binned.
3B: For WT Matrix learned mice, plotted:
- Reward with Cost Trace Sum vs reward with cost z-score (for lick frequency) for ITI, tone, and outcome periods,
- Reward and Cost Trace Sum (respectively) response period

In the figures, each ellipse represents data concentration:
- 1-10 points: yellow
- 10-100 points: orange
- over 100 points: red
Ellipse area increases with data point concentration increase. Each ellipse is for a bin (binSize = 0.25 for x axis) of the total data.
Each data point corresponds to one trial-level bin for each mouse. For each mouse, 1 bin = 200 trials.
