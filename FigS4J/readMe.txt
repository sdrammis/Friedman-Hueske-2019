For each mouse (WT n=8, HD n=6, 9 month group) all learning sessions were 
split into 3 bins. For each session in the bin, the true positive rate,
false positive rate, d' and c were calculated. True positive is
defined as a reward trial where licking occurs and false positive is
defined as a cost trial where licking occurs. Each sessions true positive
rate and and false positive rate is plotted. The d' and c means and SERRs
were calculated across animals where each observation is a mouse.
