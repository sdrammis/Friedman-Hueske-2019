Base = session during which learning occurs
Water = water devaluation session
Sucrose = sucrose devaluation session
In blue:
Plotted correlation for reward trace sum vs c for difference base-water for learning WT Strio mice.
==> Reward Trace Sum for Base minus Reward Trace Sum for Water vs C for Base minus C for Water
In red:
Plotted correlation for reward trace sum vs c for difference base-sucrose for learning WT Strio mice.
